# viewer_lemin

## Lemin project
  you got an anthill and you have to do a pathfindng into it
  
## viewer
  I made a veiwer, in that way, when the input is entered, at the end of the programm, you'll see in a little map a visualization of the anthill

### How it works

  -> compile using <ins>make,
  
  -> enter an input such as <ins> input.txt
  
  > $> ./viewer < input.txt

You'll get the viewer and the result of the parser made for the lemin
