# viewer_lemin

## Lemin project
  you got an anthill and you have to do a pathfindng into it
  
## viewer
  I made a veiwer, in that way, when the input is entered, at the end of the programm, you'll see in a little map a visualization of the anthill

### How it works

  compile using 'make', and enter an input
  
  => $> ./viewer < input.txt

You'll get the viewer and the result of the parser made for the lemin
